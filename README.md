# Data Scientist Capstone Project

## Project Overview
For the Capstone project, I attempted to tackle Dog Breed Classifier. This project requires implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architecture. In this project, I will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. We will utilize a few algorithms to identify a given dog image and predict the canineâ€™s breed. However, if supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
